A Git repository is a data structure that stores a collection of files, along with metadata about those files and the history of changes made to them. Usually those files are stored inside a dedicated folder.
To start using git, download it on its website, then run the command 'git init' on the folder you wish git to track and monitor its files.
Don't forget to configure your username and email with the commands: 'git config --local user.name <yourname>' and 'git config --local user.email <youremail>'. NOTE: if you want to add these configurations to all projects on your machine, use '--global' instead.

You can use the command 'git status' to observe the folder current status.
Use the command 'git add .' to stage all changes.
You can use the command 'git rm --cached <file_name>' to unstage the file changes.
Use the command "git commit -m "commit_msg"" to commit all staged changes.

When executing the git status command, we receive some information that may not be so clear, especially when we come across terms like HEAD, working tree, index, etc. To clarify:
- HEAD: Current state of our code, that is, where Git placed them.
- Working tree: Location where files are actually being stored and edited.
- Index: Location where Git stores what will be committed, that is, the location between the working tree and the Git repository itself.

You can use the command 'git log' to list the commits made in your repository by the most recent order.
Variations of this command, such as 'git log --oneline' can be found in 'https://devhints.io/git-log'.
To ignore certain files and folders, create a '.gitignore' file, and put the name of the files you wish to ignore.
You can use the command 'git remote' to list all the remote repositories that your local repository knows.

Remote Repositories: Git repositories can be hosted remotely on services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Remote repositories enable collaboration among multiple developers by allowing them to clone, push, and pull changes to and from a central repository.
Using 'git init --bare' in a empty folder, you can create a remote repository, even in your own machine.
Using 'git remote add <repository_name> <repository_location>', you can add this to your list of remote repositories. The location of this repository can be either a local folder, or a GitHub/GitLab link.
You can use 'git remote rename <old_repository_name> <new_repository_name>', to rename the know remote repositories.

Use 'git push <remote_repository_name> <branch_name_usually_master>', to push the committed changes into the remote repository.
Use 'git pull <remote_repository_name> <branch_name_usually_master>', to pull the remote repository files into your own.

Hint: VSCode can manage most of these commands automatically in the Source Control sidebar.
You can use the command 'git branch' to view the branches in your project.
Use the command 'git checkout -b <branch_name>' to create a new branch and go to it.
You can use the site 'https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/' to help visualize how git branches work.
When creating and modifying a new branch, the changes you made on that branch will be separeted from the master branch until these branches are merged.

To merge a branch with the Default branch, first go to the Default branch.
Use the command 'git checkout <branch_name>' to move to an existing branch.
On the Default branch, use the command 'git merge <name_of_the_other_branch>'.
If the Vim prompt opens up, you can change the commit message by altering the text in the first line.
Use ':X' to save and exit. Vim can be painfull to use so I don't recommend do anything else.
It is possible to use 'git rebase <name_of_the_other_branch>' to achieve the same result without a new commit. However, it removes the history of those changes. If you're dealing with a large team or group, you may have to avoid using that.
If you try to merge and you have conflicts, you'll have to fix those conflicts before continue.

If you want to discard modifications and you haven't commited them yet, use the command 'git checkout -- <filename>'. 
If you have added but not committed, you can use 'git reset HEAD <filename>' to unstage and undo. 
VSCode does that automatically.
If you have committed the changes already, you can run 'git revert <commit_hash_code>' to undo the commit.

If you need to keep the changes saved temporarily, but you can't commit them yet, use 'git stash'.
You can use 'git stash list' to list and see the saved changes.
You can run 'git stash apply <position_of_the_stash>' to get the saved changes back.
Then, you'll have to use 'git stash drop' to remove the stash.
Or, you can just use 'git stash pop' to do both.
To navigate throught the project versions, you can use git checkout with its previous versions to return to that point of time: 'git checkout <old_commit_hash>'
You can use the command 'git diff' to check the file changes.

To create a new tag for a stable version of your project, you can use <git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "tag_description">.
Then push these changes to add the tag to your project: "git push <remote_repository> v0.1.0".
On GitHub, this will generate a new Release of your project on the website for anyone to download and use.
